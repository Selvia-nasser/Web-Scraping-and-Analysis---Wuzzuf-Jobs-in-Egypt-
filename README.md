# **Web Scraping and Analysis - Wuzzuf Jobs in Egypt**

In this project, we successfully completed the Web Scraping and Analysis of Wuzzuf Jobs in Egypt. 
Through advanced scraping, cleaning, storing, and visualization techniques, we uncovered major patterns 
such as: 


• The dominance of Accounting, Sales, and Customer Service roles. 

• A job market that heavily favors Full-Time, On-Site work. 

• A strong demand for Entry-Level and Early-Career professionals. 

• A clear concentration of opportunities in Greater Cairo. 

• An essential mix of technical and soft skills across job postings. 
By storing the final dataset in MongoDB and building an interactive Streamlit app, we made the project 
scalable, flexible, and user-friendly for future use. 


This project not only demonstrated our technical skills in web scraping and data analysis but also our 
ability to transform raw web data into actionable insights for real-world decision-making.
